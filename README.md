### Overview
Virtualbox UI does not have a vmdk-to-sdcard mapping option. However, the documentation provides a way to use VBoxManage.exe to map an sdcard ( connected via builtin reader ) to a vmdk file.
This scripted tool automates and simplifies the process by making a user friendly console application to handle this scenario.

### Purpose Of Script
1) Primarily it was an opportunity to really learn and expand my powershell capabilities.
2) There should be an available option for this in Virtualbox UI if VBoxManage.exe has the capability and is providing a way.
