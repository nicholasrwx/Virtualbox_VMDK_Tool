### Overview
Virtualbox UI does not have a vmdk-to-sdcard mapping option. However, the documentation provides a way to use VBoxManage.exe to map an sdcard ( connected via builtin reader ) to a vmdk file.
This scripted tool automates and simplifies the process by making a user friendly console application to handle this scenario.

2) There should be an available option for this in Virtualbox UI if VBoxManage.exe has the capability and is providing a way.
